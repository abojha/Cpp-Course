STL =    Containers  +       Algorithms       +             Iterators
            |                     |                             |
        Object which        Procedure to             Object which points
        store data          process data             elements of container

Containers
      |->Sequence Containers. => Store data in Linear Fashion (vector, list, dequeue).
      |
      |->Associative Containers. => Direct Access (set, multiset, map etc).
      |
      |->Derived Containers. => Real World Modelling. (stack, queue, priority-queue).

** when to use which?
***Sequence Containers:-
1- Vector => 
            Random access is fast
            Insertion and Deletion in middle is slow.
            Insertion and Deletion at the end is fast.

2- List =>
            Random Access is slow.
            Insertion and Deletionin Middle is Fast.
            Insertion and Deletion at the End is Fast.

***Associative Containers:-
            All operations are fast except Random access.

***Derived Containers:-
            Depend -> Data Structure.
