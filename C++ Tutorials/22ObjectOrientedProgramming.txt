 Object Oriented Programming in c++
 *Works on the concept of classes and objects
   *A class is a template to create objects
   *Treats data as a critical element
   *Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and function around the objects

Terminology in OOPS : -

1. Class:- Basic template for creating objects
2. Objects:- Basic run time entities.
3.Data abstraction & Encapsulation:- Wrapping data and funtion into single unit.
4. Inheritence:- Properties of one class can inherited into others.
5.Polymorphism:- Ability to take more than one forms.
6.Dynamic Binding:- Code which will execute is not knwos until the program.
7.Message Passing:- Object message(information) call format.


Benefits of OOPs:-

* Better code reusuability using objects and inheritance.
* Principle of data hiding helps  build secure systems.
* Multiple objects can co-exist without any inheritance.
*Software complexity can be easily managed.
