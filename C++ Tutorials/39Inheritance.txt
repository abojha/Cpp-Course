##################################### Inheritance:- #############################

* Reusability is very important feature of OOPs.
* In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional feature to it.
* Reusing classes saves time and money.
* Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again.


############################## What is Inheritance in C++? ######################
* The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance.
* We can reuse the propoerties of an existing class by inheriting from it.
* The existing class is called Base class.
* The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Data.
* Reusing classes saves time and money.
* There are different types of inheritance in C++.


###############################   Types Of Inheritance ###########################
*Single Inheritance:- 
    A Derived class with only One Base Class.

*Multiple Inheritance:-
    A Derived Class with More than One Base Class.
    
*Hierarchical  Inheritance:-
    Several Derived classes from a Single Base Class.

*Multilevel Inheritance:-
    Deriving a class from already Derived Class

*Hybrid Inheritance:-
    Hybrid Inheritance is combination of Multiple Inheritance and Multilevel Inheritance.
    A Class is Derived from two class as in Multiple Inheritance.
    However, one of the Parent class is not a Base Class.
