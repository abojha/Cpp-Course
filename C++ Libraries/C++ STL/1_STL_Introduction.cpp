/*
    1.STL:- Standard Template Library
    2.It has four components
    - Containers
    - Iterator
    - Algorithm
    - Functors

                                -Containers
    *Sequential                   * Ordered                     *Unordered
        Vectors                     Maps                          Unordered Map
        Stack                       Multimap                      Unordered Set
        Queue                       Set
        Pair (not a container)      Multiset


    *Nested Containers means "Container inside container"


    -Iterators (Similar to pointers)
    *Point to memory addres of containers
    * begin(), end()
    * vecotr<int> :: iterator it;
    * continuity for containers
    

    -Algorithms
    * upper bound
    * lower bound
    * sort(comparator)
    * max-element
    * min-element
    * accumulate
    * reverse
    * count
    * find
    * next permutation
    * prev permutation
    


    -Functors
    *Classes which can act as functions
